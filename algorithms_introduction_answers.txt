// 2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. 
// It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies 
// who created an algorithm that made them successful, and what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Spotify - music preference algirithms 
Airbnb - locational preferences algorithms
Tinder - your like preferences

// 3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

What makes a good algorithm is one that produces the correct outputs for any set of legal
inputs. It should also execute efficiently with the fewest number of steps as possible. And 
it should be designed in such a way that it's understood by others so they can modify it.
